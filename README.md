# Kolitsina

Kolitsina (or Kontsina) is a Greek "fishing"-category card game
Usually played with 2 players

Each player starts with 4 cards, with 4 cards face up in the middle of the table
The non-dealer player starts, and then they switch off, taking turns until both hands are emptied, when 4 cards are then dealt to both players

# Turns
in order to make a turn, a player can either:
1. Capture a card of the same value (Ace to Ace, 5 to 5, King to King, etc)
2. Capture mutliple cards (Ace - 10) that add up to a number in your hand
   -  For example, a 4 and a 6 in the center can be captured with a 10, but a 3 and a 10 can't be captured with a King
3. Drop a card into the middle. This is usually done when no cards can be captured, but a card can be dropped whenever.

Turns are repeated until the deck is emptied. The last player to make a capture gets the remaining cards in the center.

2 points are awarded for having the most amount of cards (>26)
1 point is awarded for having the most amount of spades (>6)
